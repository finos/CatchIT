# CatchIT Secret Scanner

Goldman Sachs has developed a simple yet powerful framework called CatchIT that can be easily integrated with CI/CD and provide information about confidential security violations in JSON output in stdout. It leverages the linux commands grep and find, so that the scanner has very low execution time. We have a predefined list of regular expressions for common sensitive files and secrets found in code which can be easily extended. The regexes have been created keeping in mind the rate of false positives.

## Dependencies
1. Python3
2. Bash (Leveraging linux commands- grep and find)

## TL; DR
1. Find the sensitive files (Certs, RSA keys, AWS credentials etc)
2. Search for the confidential Information in code (Passwords, AWS keys, Conn strings etc)

## Features
1. More regular expressions can be added to the file <i>regexs.json</i>
2. It is a CI/CD friendly tool as the median time for projects varying between 1000 and 10000 LoC is 0.3 seconds.
3. The scanner provides a functionality to keep a list of sample secrets keywords or false positives in a file inverse_grep.txt. This can be leveraged to escape commonly found patterns for the reduction of false positives.
4. The scanner also leverages Shannon entropy on the findings generated by the engine to have a boolean confidence, which can be leveraged to block/warn or keep it as informatory in the pipelines.
5. Regex with only a higher confidence will be blocked/warned  

## How to run?

```
python3 catchit.py --scan-path {Scan directory path}
```
